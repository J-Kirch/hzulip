A haskell wrapper for the zulip API. This is very much a work in progress.

## Documentation
The haddock documentation is available at
[yamadapc.github.io/hzulip](https://yamadapc.github.io/hzulip). You might also
be interested in the [zulip API documentation](https://zulip.com/api/).

There's also an example bot, which does remote code evaluation on the
`bot-example` directory. It's far from perfect/complete, but since I really have
no interest in writting bots, as much as I'd have in simply hooking existing
tools into `zulip`, it's left as is. It shouldn't be too hard to improve on it
and build something that's actually useful.
